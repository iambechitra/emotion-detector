# ML Powered Sentiment Analysis Using Java

## Project Description

Emotion Detector is a machine learning-based sentiment analysis application designed to detect emotions from text. This project is developed entirely in pure Java, without the use of any third-party libraries. The application implements various supervised learning techniques to analyze sentiment from Bangla text.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis from Bangla text
- Implementation of supervised learning algorithms 
- Pure Java implementation with no external dependencies
- Efficient and accurate emotion detection

## Algorithms
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Probabilistic Topic Modeling
